Hi, I am Piotr (I guess you know it by now)!

I am a self-taught software developer, based in Krakow, Poland. Deeply in love with Ruby
and curious about Elixir and Elm. This blog was created to keep myself accountable
for my further learning (there is so much cool stuff I don't know!), as well as as
an attempt to give back to the programming community.

If you want to know more about my experience, check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piotr-klosinski-34a047b9/). If you want to actually
see some code, take a look at [my Github](https://github.com/WebDevFromScratch). And if
you just want to chat, simply send me an email to `thatsme@iampiotr.com`.
